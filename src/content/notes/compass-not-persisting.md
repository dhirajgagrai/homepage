AUR package
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mongodb-compass" target="_blank">mongodb-compass</a>
doesn't persist connection settings and favorites on subsequent launches.

Installing `gnome-keyring` solved issues for most user.<br>
In the KDE version of Manjaro, `keepassxc` can be used as an alternative.
